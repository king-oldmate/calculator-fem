## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I feel like I had already learnt this, or it should have been obvious, but **nesting react components within eachother was just something I never did before**. It made organising code and layout a lot easier than in my other projects.

### Continued development

Nesting react coponents within each other. Also, using separate CSS files for each component also helped in organising my styles.

I need to actively practice protyping, psuedo-coding, and wireframing.

### Useful resources

- [Build calculator tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/) - Not going to lie, this helped _a lot_, particularly with how to organise/structure my components.
